Homework Dash Instructions

You are a British spy that has just infiltrated an evil villain's volcano. Before you can enter, you are confronted by an angry Bill Leahy, who insists that you have to pass 2110 before you can break down the villain's complicated security system. 

He starts throwing homeworks at you, and you must prove that you are capable of shooting down all 2,110 of them before you can pass the class and beat the villain. 

Press SELECT at any time in the game to go back to the start screen.
Press START from the start screen to play the game. 

The RIGHT key moves the sad Sanjana head to the right.
The LEFT key moves the sad Sanjana head to the left.
The UP key shoots lasers out of sad Sanjana's head.

You must move sad Sanjana left and right and make her shoot the homeworks with the up key. If you let her drop more than 5 homeworks, you lose the game and are fed to the sharks in the volcano.

Good luck.
